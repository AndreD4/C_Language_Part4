# Arrays

* What is an array?

* Compound data type or data structure
  
   - Collection of elements

* All elements are of the same type.

* Each element can be access directly.


* Why do we need arrays?


Suppose we need to model my test scores in a class.

That's pretty easy. We've already seen how to use variables and this would be a perfect use of variables.

So suppose I have three test scores that I need to track,

and they're all graded as integers out of a 100.

I can simply declare three variables as integers, give them meaningful names,

initialize them to 0 or to whatever values I wish.

But what if I need to model more than just a few test scores.

Suppose I'm a school administrator, and I need to model the test scores for

100 students,

so that I could do some statistics on them.

Modeling each one of them as its own variable with its own name

can quickly get out of control.

Now I have to keep track of 100 variable names.

You could still do it but it becomes tedious and error prone.

* Characteristics

  - Fixed sizes
  
  - Elements are all the same type
 
  - Stored continuously in memory
 
  - Individual elements can be accessed by their position or index.
 
  - First element is at index 0.
 
  - Last element is at index size -1.
 
  - No checking to see if you are not out of bounds.
 
  - Always initialize arrays
 
  - very efficient
 
  - Iteration (looping) is often used to process.
