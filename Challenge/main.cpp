/*

    Write program as followed
     
    Declare 2 empty vectors of integers named
    vector1 and vector2, respectively.

    Add 10 and 20 to vector dynamically using push_back
    Display the elements in vector1 using the at() method as well as its size using the size() method
    
    Add 100 and 200 to vector2 dynamically using push_back
    Display the elements in vector2 using the at() method as well as its size using the size() method
    
    Declare an empty 2D vector_2D called vector_2d
    Remember, that a 2D vector os a vector of vector<int>
    
    Add vector1 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
    Add vector2 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
    
    Displat the elements in vector_2d again using th at() method
    
    Display the elements in vector1
    
    What did you expect? did you get what you expected? What do you think will happen?
